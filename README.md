 Air Quality Report Dashboard
📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes air quality data and visualizes key insights using an interactive dashboard.
Before visualization, I performed data cleaning tasks such as handling null values, removing unnecessary columns, and formatting the dataset properly.
The final dashboard provides a clear overview of air pollution levels across different states in India.
🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
Replaced or removed missing (null) values.
Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns.
Standardized column names for readability.
Validated AQI (Air Quality Index) values.
📈 Dashboard Highlights
Top 3 Polluted States (based on AQI levels)
Bottom 3 Least Polluted States
AQI Trend Chart showing pollution variation over time
Map Chart for a visual overview of all states and their AQI values
Clean, simple, and user-friendly interface
🧰 Tools & Technologies
Power BI – for data cleaning and visualization
Excel / CSV – for data preprocessing
Python (optional) – for additional data validation
🎯 Objective
To provide an easy-to-understand dashboard that helps users quickly identify air quality trends and pollution hotspots.
